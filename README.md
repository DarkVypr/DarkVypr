# üñ•Ô∏è [My Website](https://darkvypr.com) üåé

This was originally just somthing I made to have a single link with all of my stuff. I expanded it so I can host images [under i](https://i.darkvypr.com), files [under files](https://files.darkvypr.com) and code for my bot [under code](https://code.darkvypr.com). 

I also added redirects like:


http://twitter.darkvypr.com, http://twitch.darkvypr.com and http://git.darkvypr.com.

# ü§ñ VyprBot - A scuffed twitch chat bot ü§ñ


I made a scuffed bot called [VyprBot](https://www.twitch.tv/vyprbot). It was originally meant for [my chat](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/darkvypr/chat?popout=) but I'm also accepting requests for the bot to be added to others.

That's it for now.
